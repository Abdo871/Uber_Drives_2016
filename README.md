üöó Analyzing Uber Trip Data üöó

I recently worked on a project analyzing Uber trip data using Python. Here's a brief overview of the analysis:

The project involved analyzing a dataset of Uber trips, which provided valuable insights into the driving patterns and behaviors. Here are some of the key findings:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Sum of Kilometers Driven: Calculated the total kilometers driven for each purpose in each starting city. This helped understand the distribution of distances covered for different trip purposes in different cities.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Description of Trip Kilometers: Described the overall distribution of trip kilometers. This analysis provided insights into the typical distance traveled in Uber trips and helped identify any outliers or unusual patterns.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Description of Trip Speed: Analyzed the speed of all trips to understand the average and variation in driving speed. This information can be useful for assessing driver behavior and adherence to speed limits.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Trips from "Fort Pierce" to "Fort Pierce": Determined the number of trips and total kilometers driven for trips originating and ending in the same city. This analysis helped identify any potential anomalies or errors in the data.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Trips by Start City: Calculated the number of trips for each start city and visualized the top 10 cities. This provided insights into the popularity of Uber services in different cities.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Trips by Month: Analyzed the number of trips driven in each month of the year and visualized the top 4 months in descending order. This analysis helped identify seasonal trends and peak months for Uber trips.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Trips by Day of the Week: Explored the number of trips driven on each day of the week. This analysis provided insights into the demand for Uber services on different days.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Kilometers by Period of the Day: Examined the number of kilometers driven during different periods of the day and visualized them in descending order. This analysis helped understand the distribution of trip distances throughout the day.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Seasonal Analysis by Category: Analyzed the most driven category for each season. This analysis provided insights into the preferred trip purposes during different seasons.

Overall, this project offered valuable insights into Uber trip data, allowing for a better understanding of driving patterns, customer preferences, and seasonal variations. The analysis was conducted using Python, pandas, seaborn, and Plotly libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.
